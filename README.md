# AI-Powered Snake Game

## ðŸ¤– Developed with Cursor IDE and Claude AI

This classic Snake game was entirely developed using the power of artificial intelligence. The project showcases the capabilities of AI-assisted coding and demonstrates how AI can be leveraged to create functional and entertaining software.

### Development Process

- **IDE**: Cursor
- **AI Assistant**: Claude (Anthropic)
- **Human Input**: Minimal - primarily providing project direction and requesting specific features

The entire codebase, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, was generated through an interactive process between a human developer and Claude AI. Cursor IDE facilitated this collaboration, allowing for real-time AI suggestions and code generation.

### Features

- Classic Snake gameplay
- Multiple difficulty levels
- Responsive design
- Score tracking
- Game over screen with restart option

### AI Contributions

- Game logic implementation
- HTML structure and content
- CSS styling and animations
- JavaScript functionality, including:
  - Snake movement
  - Collision detection
  - Food generation
  - Score management
  - Game state handling

### Human Contributions

- Project initiation and concept
- Feature requests and specifications
- Code review and minor adjustments
- Testing and quality assurance
